% Define the sampling frequency
Fs = 44100; % For example

% Call the filter_definitions_JS function to get filter coefficients
[b_highpass, a_highpass, b_lowpass, a_lowpass] = filter_definitions_JS(Fs);

% Apply high-pass filter at 200 Hz
y = filter(b_highpass, a_highpass, y);

% Apply low-pass filter at 7000 Hz
y = filter(b_lowpass, a_lowpass, y);
